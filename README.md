# Classify-Song-Genres
Rock or rap? Applies machine learning methods in Python to classify songs into genres.

Using a dataset comprised of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock), trains a classifier to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information derived from Echonest (now part of Spotify). Makes use of pandas and seaborn packages in Python for subsetting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots when exploring the data for obvious trends or factors one should be aware of when doing machine learning. Uses the scikit-learn package to predict correct classification of a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc. Goes over implementations of common algorithms such as PCA, logistic regression, decision trees, and so forth. 

82% accuracy with Logistic Regression model, 76% accuracy with Decison Tree Classifier.
